/**
 * Returns an ordered list of chats in a chat list. Chats are sorted by the pair (order,
 * chat_id) in decreasing order. (For example, to get a list of chats from the beginning,
 * the offset_order should be equal to a biggest signed 64-bit number 9223372036854775807
 * == 2^63 - 1). For optimal performance the number of returned chats is chosen by the
 * library. Please note getChats() does not work for bots and you have to use getChat()
 * instead. 
 * @param {Object} params
 * @param {ChatListInputUnion} [params.chatList] - The chat list in which to return
 * chats
 * @param {string} [params.offsetOrder] - Chat order to return chats from
 * @param {number} [params.offsetChatId] - Chat identifier to return chats from
